ðŸ“˜ SQL Practice â€“ Beginner Queries


This repository contains my SQL practice exercises using MySQL. It covers fundamental concepts such as creating databases, inserting records, and writing queries to explore and analyze data.

The project uses a sample Employee Management System database with the following tables:

Employees â€“ Stores employee details (ID, name, position, hire date, etc.)

Departments â€“ Stores department information (name, budget, location)

Salaries â€“ Stores employee salary and bonus details

Projects â€“ Stores project details (name, start & end dates, budget)

Employee_Projects â€“ Many-to-many relationship between employees and projects
